# ETHOS | Cybersecurity Sandbox

**ETHOS** is an interactive simulation environment developed for the **Red River College Polytech "Sprint to Innovate 2026" Challenge**. It bridges the gap between technical cybersecurity skills and ethical decision-making, ensuring students understand that every line of code has a human consequence.

## The Challenge

**"How might we create a safe, immersive environment for students to experience the real-world ethical consequences of AI and cybersecurity decisions?"**

Technical proficiency is no longer sufficient. The core challenge addressed by **ETHOS** is the **"Silo Effect"**—where students learn to secure systems without seeing the cross-functional ripple effects of their decisions on society, law, and business.

**ETHOS** solves this by immersing students in a role-based environment where they must balance:

* **Operational Uptime** (Speed/Profit)
* **Ethical Integrity** (Fairness/Safety)
* **Regulatory Compliance** (PIPEDA/NIST)

---

## Key Features

### 1. The Compliance Gate

Before accessing the sandbox, students must interact with real-world governance documents.

* **Mandatory Review:** Access is locked until students acknowledge **RRC Academic Integrity**, **PIPEDA** (Privacy Law), and **NIST AI Risk Management** protocols.
* **Active Consent:** "I Accept" buttons are disabled until the user engages with the document or reads the "TL;DR" summary.

### 2. Real-World Scenario Engine

Students face high-pressure dilemmas adapted from real industry events:

* **Data Poisoning:** Choose between delaying a launch to scrub bias or deploying a corrupt model to meet deadlines.
* **Ransomware Negotiation:** Decide whether to pay criminals to restore patient data or follow strict "No Pay" protocols.
* **Shadow AI:** Manage internal developers leaking IP to public LLMs.

### 3. Cross-Functional Stakeholder Impact

Every decision triggers a **randomized reaction pool** from different departments:

* **Legal:** Flags liability and GDPR/PIPEDA violations.
* **PR:** Reacts to public sentiment and brand reputation.
* **C-Suite:** Focuses on budget and operational uptime.
* **Public:** Represents the human cost (e.g., patients, minority applicants).

### 4. Gamified Progression

* **Trust Score:** A live metric that fluctuates based on ethical alignment.
* **XP & Ranking:** Students progress from *Intern* to *Security Architect*.
* **Credentials:** Unlocking "Ethics Fundamentals" certificates upon reaching XP thresholds.
* **Reflection Journal:** Risky actions trigger a modal requiring students to justify their intent (logging reasoning for instructor review).

## Quick Start

ETHOS is designed as a lightweight, client-side application for easy deployment during the Sprint.

### Installation

1. Download the `index.html` file.
2. Place it in a folder (e.g., `ethos-sandbox`).
3. Double-click `index.html` to launch.

### How to Use (Demo Flow)

1. **Login:**
* Select **Red River College Polytech**.
* Enter a valid student email (must end in `@rrc.ca`, e.g., `student@rrc.ca`).
* *Dev Note: Select "Partner Institution" to bypass email restrictions for judges.*


2. **Compliance:** Click "View Doc" or "TL;DR" for all three protocols to unlock the "Enter" button.
3. **Simulate:**
* Select a scenario (e.g., "Data Poisoning").
* Choose **Ethical Action** (Safe) or **Risky Action** (Fast).
* Observe the **Stakeholder Impact** feed and your **Trust Score**.

## Future Roadmap (Post-Sprint)

* **Backend Integration:** Connect to Python/FastAPI for persistent student records.
* **Instructor Dashboard:** View class-wide Trust Scores and read "Reflection Journal" entries.
* **LLM Integration:** Replace hardcoded stakeholder text with dynamic responses generated by a local LLM (e.g., Llama 3) to create infinite scenario variations.

*Built with integrity by the ETHOS Team.
